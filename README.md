<h1 align=center>UIKit Projects</h1>
This repository has been created for the purpose of learning UIKit and the Swift programming language, and keeping track of the applications I develop. I am started this path with Atıl Samancıoğlu's Udemy course, but nowadays I'm following Angela Yu's 'IOS & Swift - The Complete IOS App Development Bootcamp' course in Udemy. Meanwhile, I'm trying to add new functionalities on top of the projects she provides.
